# Real-life-Chatbot
 This project aims to create a chatbot that can learn and communicate like a real person. By using data from the user's conversations, the chatbot can analyze language patterns and behaviors to become a virtual version of the user. This project can be used to create a personal AI assistant or to explore the possibilities of conversational AI.
