# Real-life-Chatbot
 This project aims to create a chatbot that can learn and communicate like a real person. By using data from the user's conversations (imported). The user's data is analyzed to determine language patterns and behaviors, which are then used to train the chatbot. The chatbot is able to understand and respond to the user's messages in a way that is similar to how the user would communicate.
 This can be used to create a personal AI assistant or to explore the possibilities of conversational AI in business settings.
